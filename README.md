# Project Overview

 The God's Eye project is an advanced, AI-powered real-time threat detection system designed to enhance women's safety through continuous CCTV monitoring. We successfully engineered this system to achieve a high 95% accuracy in identifying potential violence, operating at an efficient processing speed of 30 frames per second (FPS). This robust solution leverages modern computer vision techniques, utilizing Python, OpenCV, and the optimized MobileNetV2 model for immediate, high-reliability threat identification.

# Alert and Efficiency

We developed and implemented a live violence detection and alert system with a focus on speed and precision for rapid response. This system dramatically reduces the critical alert notification time to authorities to under 5 seconds, ensuring immediate threat intervention. Critically, it maintains a remarkably low 0.2% false positive rate, which minimizes unnecessary escalations and guarantees that security departments receive only genuinely actionable, high-priority threat notifications.

# Video Analysis & Scalability

The core of our platform is a powerful computer vision model, meticulously trained and validated by analyzing over 1,00 hours of diverse video footage. This intelligent automation delivered a significant improvement in operational efficiency, boosting security monitoring efficacy by 40% compared to traditional manual review. Furthermore, the constructed real-time video analytics platform, built on MobileNetV2.
